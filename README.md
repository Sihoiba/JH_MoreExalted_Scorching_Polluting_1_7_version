# JH_MoreExalted_Scorching_Polluting_1_7_version
Jupiter hell mod separated out as Epyon implemented his version of the INFERNAL and CORROSIVE exalted traits which are the equivalent to Scorching and Polluting in version 1.8

This mod replaces his version with the version I implemented against 1.7.

* POLLUTING - Demon and robot only. Enemies spread acid pools around the level and are acid immune
* SCORCHING - Demon only. Enemies spread flame patches around the level and are fire immune, but weak to cold.
